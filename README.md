# 6682stm

A tool (written in C89/ANSI C) for converting from "668" modules for [Tran's STM player](http://annex.retroarchive.org/cdrom/nightowl-006/040A/DIGISBPR/index.html) to Scream Tracker 2.21 modules.
I've tested a lot of files and so far most are not converted correctly, help is appreciated.

Building this should be simple since it uses CMake
